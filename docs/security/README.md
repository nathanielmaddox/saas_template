# Security & Compliance Documentation

This section provides comprehensive security documentation and compliance guidance for enterprise deployment of the SaaS template.

## Security Framework Overview

The SaaS template implements a **Security by Design** approach with multiple layers of protection, comprehensive monitoring, and compliance-ready features for Fortune 500 enterprise requirements.

### Security Principles
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers and controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary access rights
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Privacy by Design**: Data protection built into the system
- **Continuous Security**: Automated security testing and monitoring
