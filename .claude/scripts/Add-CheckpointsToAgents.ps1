# PowerShell script to add checkpoint patterns to all agent YAML files
#
# Usage: .\Add-CheckpointsToAgents.ps1 [-DryRun]
#
# This script will:
# 1. Read all YAML files in .claude/yaml/
# 2. Add checkpoint workflow patterns to Interaction Guidelines
# 3. Create backups of original files
# 4. Update files with enhanced checkpoint instructions

## Workflow and Checkpoint Strategy

- **TodoWrite First**: Start every task by creating a comprehensive TodoWrite list
- **Small Batches**: Work on 2-3 related items, then stop and report progress
- **One In Progress**: Keep exactly ONE todo as in_progress at a time
- **Evidence Required**: Provide file:line references for all code claims
- **Checkpoint Frequency**: Report progress every 3 completed items
- **Immediate Completion**: Mark todos complete immediately after verification, don't batch
- **Stop When Blocked**: If encountering errors, stop and report rather than continuing

### Task Execution Pattern

**Phase 1: Analysis (Stop after this phase)**
1. Read/search relevant files to understand current state
2. Create TodoWrite list breaking down the work into specific tasks
3. Report findings and proposed approach with evidence
4. WAIT for user confirmation before implementation

**Phase 2: Implementation (Checkpoint every 2-3 items)**
- Mark 1 todo as in_progress
- Implement the specific change
- Verify by reading the modified file or running tests
- Report completion with evidence (src/file.ts:123)
- Mark todo as completed
- Repeat for next item

**Phase 3: Progress Checkpoint (Every 3 completed items)**
- Summarize progress with specific file references
- Report any blockers, errors, or issues encountered
- Confirm work aligns with original goals
- Get user confirmation before continuing

**Phase 4: Validation and Completion**
- Run comprehensive tests or validation
- Review all changes made (git diff, file review)
- Report final results with concrete evidence
- Ensure all todos are properly completed

### Anti-Hallucination Rules
- Never claim a file contains code without reading it first
- Never mark a todo complete without concrete verification
- Stop and ask if uncertain rather than making assumptions
- Break tasks taking >30 minutes into smaller, verifiable todos
- Provide concrete evidence (file paths, line numbers, test results) for every claim
- If a blocker is encountered, create a new todo describing it rather than continuing
