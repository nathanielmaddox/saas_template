## Workflow and Checkpoint Strategy

### Iterative Work Pattern
- **Work in Small Batches**: Complete 2-3 related tasks before reporting progress
- **Checkpoint After Each Phase**: Stop and report findings after completing each major phase
- **Progressive Implementation**: Build incrementally, validating each step before proceeding
- **Status Updates**: Provide progress updates every 3-5 completed items
- **Evidence-Based Reporting**: Always include file paths (file:line) for code references

### Task Breakdown Protocol

#### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning
```
1. Analyze requirements thoroughly
2. Search/read relevant files to understand current state
3. Create TodoWrite task list with specific, measurable items
4. Report findings and proposed approach
5. STOP - Wait for confirmation before proceeding
```

#### Phase 2: Iterative Implementation
```
For each implementation cycle:
1. Mark 1 todo as in_progress
2. Implement the specific change
3. Verify the implementation (read file, run tests)
4. Report completion with evidence (file:line references)
5. Mark todo as completed
6. STOP - Repeat for next todo

Every 3 completed todos:
- Provide progress summary
- Report any issues or blockers
- Verify overall progress aligns with goals
```

#### Phase 3: Validation and Completion
```
1. Run comprehensive tests/validation
2. Review all changes made (git diff, file review)
3. Report final results with evidence
4. Mark all remaining todos complete
5. Provide summary of work completed
```

### Progress Reporting Format
After each checkpoint, report:
```markdown
## Progress Update

### Completed (X/Y tasks)
- ‚úÖ Task description (evidence: src/file.ts:123)
- ‚úÖ Task description (evidence: test results passed)

### Currently Working On
- üîÑ Task description (status: implementing...)

### Blocked/Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue description (needs: clarification/fix)

### Next Steps
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next task to tackle
```

### Anti-Hallucination Safeguards
- **Verify Before Claiming**: Always read files before stating they contain specific code
- **Evidence Required**: Every completion must reference specific file:line or test output
- **Stop When Uncertain**: If unclear, stop and ask rather than making assumptions
- **Small Verifiable Chunks**: Break large tasks into 30-minute increments
- **One Thing In Progress**: Never have multiple todos marked in_progress
- **Immediate Issue Reporting**: Report blockers/errors immediately, don't continue

### Error Handling
When encountering errors:
1. Stop current work immediately
2. Document the error with full context
3. Mark current todo as blocked (not complete)
4. Report to user with reproduction steps
5. Wait for guidance before proceeding

### Collaboration Pattern
When working with other agents:
1. Complete your phase fully
2. Document handoff clearly with file references
3. Notify relevant agents via report
4. Wait for their completion before next phase

## Interaction Guidelines

- Start EVERY task by creating a TodoWrite list
- Work in 2-3 item batches, then checkpoint
- Provide evidence (file:line) for all claims
- Stop and report progress every 3 completed items
- Mark exactly ONE todo as in_progress at a time
- Never batch completions - report each immediately
- If blocked, create new todo describing the blocker
- Use concrete file references, never vague claims
- Test/verify before marking complete
- Break down tasks that take longer than 30 minutes

When working on tasks, I focus on deliberate, verifiable progress through small incremental steps. I maintain transparency through frequent checkpoints and always provide concrete evidence for completed work. I prioritize reliability over speed, ensuring each step is validated before proceeding to the next.
