# Claude Agentic Structure

This directory contains the foundational structure and templates for Claude AI integration in this SaaS template application.

## Overview

The agentic structure serves as the starting point for Claude AI interactions, providing context, templates, and documentation that enable effective AI-assisted development.

## Integration with YAML Agent Definitions

This agentic structure works in conjunction with the YAML agent definitions located in `.claude/yaml/`. The relationship is:

### YAML Agent Repository
- **Location**: `.claude/yaml/*.yaml`
- **Purpose**: Detailed agent specifications with comprehensive expertise domains
- **Format**: YAML frontmatter with structured agent definitions
- **Content**: Deep technical specifications for specialized agents

### Agent Creation Process

1. **YAML as Source of Truth**: The `.claude/yaml/` directory contains comprehensive agent specifications
2. **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Agents can be created from YAML specifications as needed
3. **Template Integration**: Uses `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md` as the base structure
4. **Technology Alignment**: References `TECHNOLOGY_STACK_VERSIONS.md` for current versions

### Key YAML Agent Categories

The YAML definitions include specialized agents across multiple domains:

#### Mobile & Cross-Platform
- Flutter, React Native, iOS Swift UI
- Android Kotlin, Xamarin, Ionic
- Mobile performance & security optimization

#### Analytics & Business Intelligence
- Data science, business intelligence
- Dashboard creation, KPI analysis
- Customer analytics, marketing analytics
- A/B testing, cohort analysis

#### Deployment & Infrastructure
- AWS, Azure, GCP cloud architects
- Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform
- Monitoring, CI/CD, security management
- Cost optimization, backup & recovery

### Usage Instructions

#### For Claude AI
When starting work on this project:

1. **Reference this README** for project structure understanding
2. **Check YAML agents** in `.claude/yaml/` for available specialized agents
3. **Use TECHNOLOGY_STACK_VERSIONS.md** for current technology versions
4. **Apply quality gates** from `QUALITY_GATES.md`
5. **Follow deployment procedures** from `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

#### For Development Teams
1. **Update CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md** with project-specific context
2. **Keep TECHNOLOGY_STACK_VERSIONS.md** current with latest versions
3. **Add new YAML agents** as project needs evolve
4. **Reference agent specifications** when planning development tasks

## Agent Selection Strategy

### Dynamic Agent Utilization
- **Assess project needs** before selecting agents
- **Reference YAML specifications** for detailed capabilities
- **Create agents on-demand** based on current requirements
- **Avoid over-provisioning** unused agents

### YAML Agent Categories by Priority

1. **Core Development** (Always Available)
   - Frontend/Backend development managers
   - API architecture leads
   - Database design specialists

2. **Quality Assurance** (Proactive)
   - Testing specialists
   - Security audit agents
   - Performance optimizers

3. **Specialized Domains** (As Needed)
   - Mobile development specialists
   - Cloud architecture experts
   - Analytics and BI specialists

4. **Compliance & Security** (Industry-Specific)
   - GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS specialists
   - Penetration testing agents
   - Compliance auditing specialists

## Best Practices

### For AI Integration
- **Start with this README** to understand project context
- **Reference YAML agents** for specialized knowledge
- **Use templates** for consistent documentation
- **Maintain technology currency** with version tracking

### For Development Teams
- **Keep documentation updated** with project evolution
- **Add new YAML agents** for emerging needs
- **Reference quality gates** before releases
- **Use monitoring tools** for development efficiency

## Template Customization

The `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md` serves as the foundation for project-specific `CLAUDE.md` files:

1. **Copy template** to project root as `CLAUDE.md`
2. **Customize placeholders** with project-specific information
3. **Reference YAML agents** for specialized requirements
4. **Update regularly** with project evolution

## Technology Integration

The agentic structure ensures:
- **Current technology versions** via `TECHNOLOGY_STACK_VERSIONS.md`
- **Specialized expertise** via YAML agent definitions
- **Quality standards** via documentation templates
- **Development efficiency** via monitoring tools

This structure enables effective Claude AI collaboration while maintaining project organization and development standards.
