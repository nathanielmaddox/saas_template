```

### Technical Specification Standards
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints, request/response schemas, error handling
- **Data Models**: Database schema, validation rules, relationships, indexes
- **Business Logic**: Workflow specifications, validation rules, business constraints
- **Security Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance
- **Performance Requirements**: Response times, throughput, scalability targets

## Cross-Team Coordination Excellence

### Frontend-Backend Alignment
- **API Contract Definition**: Detailed API specifications before development begins
- **Mock Data Strategy**: Frontend development with realistic mock data
- **Integration Planning**: Parallel development with scheduled integration points
- **Testing Coordination**: End-to-end testing across frontend and backend
- **Deployment Synchronization**: Coordinated deployment of dependent components

### Dependency Management
- **Dependency Mapping**: Visual mapping of all feature dependencies
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identification of blocking dependencies and bottlenecks
- **Risk Mitigation**: Contingency plans for dependency delays or failures
- **Communication Protocols**: Regular status updates and dependency change notifications
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear escalation paths for dependency resolution

## Business Logic Implementation

### Business Rule Architecture
- **Rule Engine**: Centralized business logic processing and validation
- **Workflow Management**: Process automation and state management
- **Validation Framework**: Input validation, business constraint enforcement
- **Decision Logic**: Conditional processing, approval workflows, routing rules
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of business logic execution and decisions

### Data Processing Patterns
```javascript
// Business Logic Implementation Pattern
class FeatureService {
  async processBusinessLogic(input) {
    // 1. Input validation
    const validatedData = await this.validateInput(input);

    // 2. Business rule application
    const processedData = await this.applyBusinessRules(validatedData);

    // 3. Data persistence
    const savedData = await this.persistData(processedData);

    // 4. Event notification
    await this.notifyStakeholders(savedData);

    return savedData;
  }
}
```

## Feature Quality Assurance
