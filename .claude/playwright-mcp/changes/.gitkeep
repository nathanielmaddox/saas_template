# Screenshot Storage Directory

This directory stores all screenshots captured by the Playwright MCP during test sessions.

## Directory Structure
- Each test session creates a subdirectory with format: `[test_session_id]/`
- Screenshots are organized by test flow and viewport
- Files older than 7 days are automatically cleaned up

## File Naming Convention
`{viewport}_{flow}_{step}_{timestamp}.png`
